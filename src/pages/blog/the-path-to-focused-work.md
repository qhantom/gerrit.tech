# The path to focused work

## Actual state of most people and negative consequences

A large proportion of people allow themselves to be interrupted every 11 minutes on average. That is enormous. In addition to this, it is important to remember that we need around 20 minutes to be able to concentrate on an activity again. This does not only concern interruptions caused by the smartphone, by emails, chat messages or by colleagues, but a large part of the interruptions are also caused by internal factors, such as open to-dos that have not been written down, worries, mind wandering / daydreaming lack of motivation and much more. These promote constant change of focus and we look for new, more interesting stimuli in our environment. The consequences are a lack of motivation and a lower quality of work. If we then manage to sit down and be productive despite a lack of drive, we cannot speak of concentration.

However, lack of concentration is not only promoted by internal and external interruptions, but also by a disorderly sleep rhythm, lack of physical and mental balance while working (e.g. taking a few minutes break every hour and increasing the pulse) and poor nutrition. Other factors include negative/destructive topics when interacting with colleagues or news from around the world, dopamine overstimulation from social media consumption, an untidy desk that hinders thought processes, and an unplanned or unstructured day. Multitasking also weakens our concentration enormously.

## How to find a way

In order to be able to talk about concentration at all, we have to be clear about what concentration is. When we concentrate, we focus our entire attention on one thing and automatically tune out external influencing factors. We are absorbed in a task and sometimes have the feeling that we are no longer aware of ourselves. The question is how we can induce and favor such a state.

Concentration can be trained like a sport. Accordingly, it must be practiced. We know that all beginnings are difficult, especially when it comes to habits, which is why a few concrete recommendations are given below.

## What promotes concentration?

One of the most important steps is to identify and eliminate distractions in the concentration environment. As mentioned in the above section, these can be internal and external factors. For example, we may be working in a concentrated manner and suddenly a thought appears in our head that tells us "I still have to wish my mother a happy birthday". Just we are pulled out of our (seemingly) focused state and our work quality suffers. This kind of interruption by opportune to-dos can be eliminated e.g. by a daily schedule (e.g. 6:30 pm: congratulate mother). This way, the mind knows that this task is already scheduled for today and it doesn't need to remind it. If we do without a daily schedule or similar, the mind will keep sending new impulses that will interfere with us every time.

Not only interruptions, but the whole lifestyle influences our ability to concentrate. Below I have listed tips on how to optimize one's lifestyle in small ways, with big, positive consequences:

- dopamine detox: no social media, no smartphone, no internet for at least one day a week
- exercise several times a week (for at least 30 minutes)
- frame the day in meditation (a few minutes each morning and evening)
- healthy diet with plenty of vegetables
- reading books -> reading is a very strong gauge and training ground for increasing one's ability to concentrate.
- be creative (paint, draw, write, etc.)
- listen to binaural music while working
- proper sleep, is favored by:
  - in the evening wear anti-blue light glasses (night mode on devices is not enough)
  - in summer: lower the blinds and sleep in a dark room without light sources
  - alarm clock with rising melody, no emergency alert (this catapults us - evolutionarily - from sleep to maximum alertness and is harmful in the long run)
  - end the day with mindfulness exercises like meditation or yoga and go directly to bed in this state of mind
  - after getting up, directly stimulate circulation (jumping rope, push-ups, squats, etc.). It is important that the pulse rises and the body becomes fresh).
  - take a power nap (approx. 20 - 30 minutes, not longer)
- plan / structure day
  - "the key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule but to schedule your priorities." (Steven Covey)
  - schedule the most important tasks in the first hours when there is the most energy -> in the morning, because that's when we have:
    - a stronger willpower
    - more energy in the brain to focus deeply and think clearly and solve challenging problems/tasks
  - schedule less important tasks for the times when there is less energy, usually 7 - 9 hours after waking up (the well-known midday slump)
  - the last 7 hours of the day are ideal for creative work, innovations, collecting ideas, etc.

## Conclusion

As we can see, there are numerous factors that can and usually do influence our concentration. To that end, it should be said that this article only scratches the surface. Topics such as time management, productivity (not toxic productivity), self-optimization (not over-optimization), self-control, etc. would be far beyond the scope. However, I can only encourage you to look into the topics.

Furthermore, I recommend not to implement too much at once, but to adjust your lifestyle peu รก peu. For some measures, such as adjusting sleep habits, positive results will be seen after just a few days. It is also important to mention that not only concentration will enjoy a boost, but the entire attitude towards life will change. The energy balance draws from sources that were previously de facto non-existent, our creativity capacity increases, and we make better decisions.
